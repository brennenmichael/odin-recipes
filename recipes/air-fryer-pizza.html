    <h3>This air fryer pizza is one of my favorites. Not only is it super easy 
        and super quick to make, but it's a lot healthy than regular pizza (and a lot cheaper too!</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Naan bread (shaped like a circle)</li>
        <li>Cheese of choice</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Pepperoni, sausage, or any other toppings you see fit!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees. Set the air fryer timer to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>While fryer is preheating, spread pizza sauce onto naan bread.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese on top of sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with any toppings you see fit. Be careful with lighter toppings like pepperoni -- they may go flying!
            I find that either covering them with cheese or pressing them down into the sauce/bread helps.</li>
        <li>Load into basket or onto tray and let cook.</li>
        <li> Let cool and feel your connection to mother Italia.</li>
    </ol>
