    <p>According to the legendary Chef Gusteaux, "anyone can cook." But here's the problem with Gusteaux's ambiguity... can anyone cook 
        <em>well?</em> Of course, I believe I know everything just from watching an episode of two of "Chopped", but put me in front of 
        an oven, stove, or similar cooking appliance and I'm as lost as a golf ball in high weeds.</p>

    <p>Enter the air fryer, savior of those who are culinarily challenged (such as myself). Not only are air fryer recipes super easy to 
        make, many require relatively few ingredients (although you can certainly spice it up!) and are a lot healthier than their original 
        counterparts! Check out the recipes below, and you too can enjoy the finest dining that your air fryer can cook up.</p>
